# My ToDoApp
Here is my Todo App.

## Story of this App
This app is my first attempt to really build some kind of app.

I am using the process from the website:

http://watchandcode.com

## Tools and Language

I am writing this app in Javascript. This is my first time studying Javascript (more or less).

Framework: I will try to integrate Bootstrap into this app.

Editor: I am just learning to use VSCode. I like the github integration so far. As a new developer getting green boxes is cool on my profile.
